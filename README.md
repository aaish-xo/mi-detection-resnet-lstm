MI Classification from Echocardiographic Videos (A4C & A2C Views)
This project builds deep learning models to detect myocardial infarction using echocardiographic videos from the HMC-QU dataset.
We use ResNet18 + LSTM for spatiotemporal modeling and Grad-CAM for model interpretability.

Note: The dataset is not included due to license restrictions. Please request access from the original authors at HMC-QU dataset page.
